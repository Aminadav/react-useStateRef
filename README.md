# react-useStateRef

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-usestateref"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=npm&message=react-useStateRef"></a>

useRef and UseState together!

## How to use

### Installation

```shell
$ npm i react-usestateref
```

```javascript
import useState from 'react-usestateref'
function MyComponent(){
  var [state,setState,ref]=useState(0)
  // ref.current will always have the latest state  
}
```

As you can see it's 100% backward compatible. You can replace all your `useState` with this import and you will always have the latest state.

## Motivation:

Many StackOverflow questions that people struggling to get the current state

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54069253/usestate-set-method-not-reflecting-change-immediately
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60438537/usestate-shows-previous-value-always
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57847594/react-hooks-accessing-up-to-date-state-from-within-a-callback
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55874789/using-react-hooks-why-are-my-event-handlers-firing-with-the-incorrect-state

In React when functions accessing the state they receive the state from the moment
the function defined - not the current state.

So if the state changed, your functions and effects my use older state.

Using `useRef`, can solve it because it have always one value. But when you update the Ref it's not re-render.

See the example code:

```js
function MyComponent(){
  var [counter,setCounter]=useState(0)
  function increment(){
    setCounter(counter+1)
    alert(counter) // will show 0 since the state not updated yet.			
  }
  useEffect(()=>{
    alert(counter) // Whatever is the current state. It always alert 0
    return ()=>{
        alert(counter) // On unmount it still alert 0, even if you called increment many times.
    }
  },[])
  return (
  <div>
    Current number: {counter}
    <button onClick={increment}>
      Increment
    </button>
  </div>)
}
```

To solve it I created a new hook `useStateRef`

See it in action:

```js
import useState from 'react-usestateref' // see this line
function MyComponent(){
  var [counter,setCounter,counterRef]=useState(0)
  function increment(){
    setCounter(counter+1)
    alert(counterRef.current) // will show 1
  }
  useEffect(()=>{
    alert(counterRef.current) // Always show the last value
    return ()=>{
        alert(counterRef.current) // // Always show the last value
    }
  },[])
  return (
  <div>
    Current number: {counter}
    <button onClick={increment}>
      Increment
    </button>
  </div>)
}
```

It's fully support the `useState` API, so you can change your `useState` to `useStateRef` and it will not break your app.
